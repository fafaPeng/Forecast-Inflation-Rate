Forecast-Inflation-Rate
1. Background
Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, western nations have seen a rapid increase in inflation rates. The primary causes for this are labor shortages leading to supply shocks and rising expenditure on goods, fueled by government stimulus packages. Among all western advanced countries, the U.S. has been hit hardest by high inflation. In June, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported a Consumer Price Index-based inflation rate of 9.1%â€”the highest in over four decades. To combat this, the Federal Reserve has hiked the target interest rate five times in the past year.

High inflation rates negatively impact a country's economy in two significant ways:
   1. Reduced Purchasing Power: The domestic currency loses its purchasing power, causing people to spend more money on the same goods.
   2. Lower Savings and Investments: People have less money to save, and returns from investments are reduced.

2. Goal
The aim of this project is to fit a time-series model to forecast future inflation rate trends in the U.S. This will assist the Federal Reserve in adjusting the target interest rate to maintain economic stability. Striking a balance is crucial: raising interest rates too much could plunge the economy into a recession, while too little change would be ineffective.

3. Data
Although various indices can measure the inflation rate, we have chosen to use the "12-Month Percent Change in Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers," which includes all items in the U.S. city average and is not seasonally adjusted. The data range spans from 2000 to 2022 and is published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. This index is a widely-accepted measure of inflation.
